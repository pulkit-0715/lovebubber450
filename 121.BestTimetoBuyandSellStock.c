121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Easy
Topics
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104*/
#include <stdio.h>
int min(int a, int b) {
    return (a < b) ? a : b;
}
int max(int a, int b) {
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}
int maxProfit(int* prices, int pricesSize) {
    int profit =0;
    int mini=prices[0];

    for(int i=1;i<pricesSize;i++)
    {
        int diff = prices[i]-mini;
        profit=max(diff, profit);
        mini=min(prices[i],mini);
    }
    return profit;
}

int main(){

    int arr2[]={7,1,5,3,6,4};
    printf("%d\n",maxProfit(arr2,6));


    int arr[]={7,6,4,3,1};
    printf("%d",maxProfit(arr,5));
    
    return 0;
